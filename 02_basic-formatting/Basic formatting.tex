	\maketitle
	
	\section{Inroduction}
	Basic formatting tags in \LaTeX
	
	\subsection{Text Formatting}
	All the things you want to do, and sometimes should... emphasis on SOMETIMES.
	
	\textbf{Bold Formatting} is only between the curly braces.
	
	\emph{Italic Formatting}
	
	\underline{Underline Formatting}
	
	\subsection{Paragraph Formatting}
	New paragraph are automatically indented.
	
	\noindent But sometimes you don't want them to be.
	
	\section{Oddities}
	Strange things I noticed
	
	\subsection{Misqouting}
	This is how I would normally type 'single and "double" quotes. Does it look odd?
	
	\noindent Use that \emph{other} quote key you've probably never used before to make it better.
	
	\noindent See my new 'single' quotes, and ''double'' quotes? That's better.
	
	\section{Conclusion}
	These are just a few of the basics elements in a \LaTeX file
