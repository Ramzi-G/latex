	\maketitle
	
	\section{Introduction}
	This document will include some math.
	
	\subsection{Math Formulas}
	Mathematical equations can be be created inline as $5 * 4 = 20$, and can include a number of different math symbols, such as $7 \leq 10$ is true. 
	
	You can also put your equation on a separate line as \[5^2 = 25\] to call out the formula.
		
	\subsection{Float: Equations}
	My first result is shown in Equation~\ref{eg:minutes}, which shows the number of minutes in a day.
	\begin{equation}
		24*60 = 1,440
		\label{eg:minutes}
	\end{equation}
	
	There are a lot of interesting math symbols that I can learn, as shown in Equation\ref{eg:symbols}.
	\begin{equation}
		7^4 + 6*17 \geq 13 \cup X \alpha 13 \exists \rightarrow nonsense
		\label{eg:symbols}
	\end{equation}
	
	\section{Conclusion}
	And it was a brief introduction on math in \LaTeX.
